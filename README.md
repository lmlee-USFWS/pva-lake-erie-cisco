# pva-lake-erie-cisco

## Overview

This repository contains a R Shiny application that allows users to run a population viability analysis for Cisco in Lake Erie. The analysis is based on a stochastic Leslie matrix projection model (female-only). The model computes population persistence for user-specified scenarios.

Information about restoring coregonines to the Great Lakes can be found [here](https://www.greatlakesciscoes.org/).

`list.of.packages <- c("compositions","dplyr","EnvStats","ggplot2","mpmsim","popbio","readxl",
"reshape2","rhandsontable","shiny","shinyalert","shinycssloaders","shinydashboard","shinyjs",
"utils")`

`new.packages <- list.of.packages[!(list.of.packages %in% installed.packages()[,"Package"])]`

`if(length(new.packages)) install.packages(new.packages)`

`shiny::runGitHub("pva-lake-erie-cisco","lmlee-USFWS")`
